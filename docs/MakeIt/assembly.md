# Assemble Your SmartAss Plug

Assembly of a SmartAss Plug is not difficult. But take your time and do the steps with care to achieve the optimal result.

## Glueing in the Vibration Motor

!!! info "This chapter does not apply for the SmartAss Plug XS"

    The SmartAss Plug XS does not feature a vibration motor. You can omit this step and continue with vapour smoothing.

As a very first step check wether the tip fits nicely on the plug. By slightly screwing the tip on it should stick without leaving a visible gap. If your seems are noticeable, sand them on the inside and the outside of the conus.

![SmartAss Plug Wires](/img/MotorSolderWire.jpg){ width="480" }

Soldering around 20-30 cm of silicone wire onto the motor terminals of the vibration motor. The polarity or the color of the wires doesn't matter. Carefully thread the wires one-by-one through the center hole into the main body.

![SmartAss Plug Press Fit](/img/MotorPressFit.jpg){ width="480" }

Press the motor into the press-fit of the plug. This requires some force. If not, then you should consider working on your printers dimensional accuracy and reprint the part. The housing of the motor should only sick around 1-2 mm out of the plug's body.

![SmartAss Plug Prepare Weld](/img/WeldPrepare.jpg){ width="480" }

Prepare the weld by preparing some acetone and a acetone-proof brush. ASA and ABS can be welded by dissolving the surface with acetone. This weld is extremely strong and destructive testing showed, that it is impossible to destroy.

!!! warning "This will only work if you have printed the parts in ASA or ABS"

    If you've printed your plug in an other material check what kind of solvent you need to do the weld. Glueing should be possible as well, but won't lead to nice results.

!!! danger "Welding is a critical step!"

    The acetone evaporates rather quick. The parts must be pressed on wet on both sides of the cone. Work quickly and accurate. Rework is not possible once it is welded.

Apply the acetone on both, inside and outside of the cones. Work quickly, as the acetone evaporates fast. Add a second or third round of acetone if needed. The parts must be pressed together wet in wet. Don't mind if the acetone will run onto other parts of your print. This will be taken care of during post processing.

![SmartAss Plug Weld Seam](/img/WeldSeam.jpg){ width="480" }

Press the tip on the plug with as much force as possible. A twisting motion will distribute molten plastic inside the seam and fill the gaps. The ideal seam will noticeably bulge.

![SmartAss Plug Sanding Seam](/img/WeldFinish01.jpg){ width="480" }

Once the weld has solidified you can start sanding away the seam with sandpaper. Start with 120 grid and work towards finer grids.

## Vapour Smooth the Plug

!!! warning "This will only work if you have printed the parts in ASA or ABS"

    If you've printed your plug in an other material check what kind of solvent you need to do the polishing. Or you need to do the post processing completely manual.

!!! danger "Acetone is Dangerous!"

    Acetone is a dangerous chemical. It is highly inflammable and can lead to explosives atmospheres. Read the MSDS that comes with your bottle of acetone. Do the vapour smoothing only in a well ventilated area, preferably outside. Take precautions and keep away any ignition source (electronics, fire, heater, ...)

For an optimal, high-gloss, germ friendly and watertight finish the plug must be polished with acetone fumes. For optimal results you should sand away the layer lines.

<img src="/img/WeldFinish03.jpg" style="width:320px"> 
</div>

Start with fine sandpaper and continue with the scotch-brite. First the red, medium coarse. And finally the black fine non-woven. Take your time for this step. The better the layer lines disappear, the better will be the polished results.

Remove any dust and finger prints from sanding with IPA and a lint-free cloth. If you have a plug with vibration motor stow away te excess cables inside the electronics compartment.

![SmartAss Plug Acetone Polish](/img/PolishJar.jpg){ width="480" }

Use a pickles jar big enough to contain the whole plug. Inside the jar place some paper towels to hold the acetone. This should be at the very top of the jar, so that the acetone vapour concentration is also up there. Wet the paper towels with acetone. Make sure that you do not over-saturate them. There should be no acetone running down the sides.

Place the plug on a acetone proof surface like a metal build plate and let the vapour do its magic. Depending on the temperature and the filament brand this can take up to 30-60 minutes.

!!! tip "Test the process with a benchy"

    Test how your particular filament brand smooth with some excess benchies.

Once the time is up remove the jar and let the plug dry. Do not touch the plug until it's fully solidified again. Properly discard the acetone and let it evaporate outside.
