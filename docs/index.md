!!! Question "Can I sell this on my webshop?"

    Yes, of course! You may start producing the PCB and the plug and sell it on your shop. The license was deliberately chosen to allow a commercial use by whoever is willing to go through the woes of starting their own business. However, the techno-kinky scene is rather limited in size and thus you must give back any improvements such that the kinky maker scene can take advantages of it.
